# Dijkstra's Algorithm

## üìñ Overview
Dijkstra's Algorithm is a famous **greedy algorithm** used to find the **shortest path** between a source node and all other nodes in a **weighted graph** with **non-negative edge weights**.

It is widely used in:
- **Routing protocols** (e.g., GPS navigation, network routing)
- **Graph-based problems** in competitive programming
- **Operations research** and **logistics**

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
1. **Initialize** the distance to the source node as 0 and to all other nodes as infinity.
2. **Use a priority queue (min-heap)** to greedily select the node with the smallest known distance.
3. **Update the distances** of neighboring nodes if a shorter path is found through the current node.
4. **Repeat** until all nodes have been visited or the target is reached.

## üõ†Ô∏è Pseudocode

```plaintext
function Dijkstra(graph, source):
    dist[source] = 0
    for each vertex v in graph:
        if v ‚â† source:
            dist[v] = infinity
        add v to priority queue

    while priority queue is not empty:
        u = extract-min(priority queue)
        for each neighbor v of u:
            alt = dist[u] + weight(u, v)
            if alt < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = alt
                update priority queue with new distance
```

## üß† Key Concepts
- **Priority Queue**: Used to efficiently fetch the next node with the smallest tentative distance.
- **Greedy Approach**: Always picks the next closest node.
- **Works only with non-negative weights**.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Complexity
| Data Structure | Time Complexity |
| :------------- | :-------------- |
| Simple Array Priority Queue | O(V¬≤) |
| Binary Heap + Adjacency List | O((V + E) log V) |
| Fibonacci Heap | O(E + V log V) (theoretical, but rarely used in practice) |

Where:
- **V** = number of vertices
- **E** = number of edges

## ‚úçÔ∏è Notes for Interviews
- Always ask if the graph is **directed or undirected**.
- Clarify if **negative weights** exist (if yes, Dijkstra is **not** the right algorithm; use **Bellman-Ford**).
- Use **heap** for optimal performance.
- Think about **early stopping** if you only need shortest distance to a **target node**, not all nodes.
